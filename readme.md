## LaunchBot rework in Go

### Goals of the rework
ðŸŒŸ **Massively improve code quality** and project layout

ðŸŒŸ **Improve robustness** and error recoverability of the backend

ðŸŒŸ **Intelligently dequeue messages** to stay within API limits

ðŸŒŸ **Remove excessive complexity** in storage and caching

ðŸŒŸ **Enable extending the bot** to other platforms through modularity

ðŸŒŸ **Reuse proven Python logic** where possible with direct translation

ðŸŒŸ **Improve performance** by simply switching to Go

			- Easy to do with user.Flush()

- [ ] Add commands

	- [x] /next
	- [x] /schedule
	- [x] /stats

		- [ ] Check for mute status
	- [ ] Mute notifications
	- [x] Sending

- [ ] Other, backend
	- [ ] Update stats wherever needed
	- [ ] Regularly dump statistics to disk, especially on ctrl+c

- [ ] Database migration from v2 to v3
	- [ ] Acceptable level of data lost?
		- [ ] Manually map launch provider names to IDs

### Must-haves before 3.0.0
- [x] "Compress" messages to improve send-rates
	- [x] Add "More info" button
		- [x] Implement for description
		- [ ] Implement for reuse information
- [x] Remove manual time zone feature to reduce complexity
- [ ] Purge log-files when they become too large
	- Also, be smarter about telebot's logging (raise an issue?)

### Nice-to-haves before 3.0.0
- [x] Notify admin on any processing failure
	- [x] Telegram
- [x] Allow postpone notifications to be disabled
- [ ] Allow chats to flip a setting to enable everyone to send commands (callbacks only by the initial sender?)

### Future: 3.1 and onwards
- [ ] Handle window starts/ends
	- Instead of continuous postponements, notify of window start -> 5 min notification
- [ ] Support for general event types (event/upcoming endpoint)
