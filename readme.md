# LaunchBot â€“ a rocket launch information and notifications bot for Telegram ðŸš€
LaunchBot keeps you up to date with what's going up, around the clock, since 2019. Over 900'000 notifications delivered to thousands of chats and groups!

Reachable as [@rocketrybot](https://t.me/rocketrybot) on Telegram.

## Features
LaunchBot uses the LaunchLibrary2 API to fetch launch information on scheduled intervals. The bot provides multiple forms of information: launch notifications, information about upcoming flights, and a simple flight schedule displaying upcoming flights at a glance.

Other features include...
- user-configurable notifications on a per-provider and per-country basis
- user-configurable notification times from 4 different options
- notifications of launches being postponed
- muteable launches
- direct links to launch webcasts
- automatically cleared notification messages
- simple information refresh with Telegram's message buttons
- spam management for groups (removes requests the bot won't respond to)

## Basic instructions
1. Clone the repository and install all dependencies with `go get all`

2. `cd` into `/cmd` with `cd cmd`

3. Build the program with `./build.sh`. This may require you to allow executing the script: this can be done with `chmod +x build.sh`

4. `cd` back into the main folder with `cd ..`

Now, you can run the program: to start, open a new terminal window, and run `./launchbot`. The bot will ask you for a Telegram bot API key: you can get one from BotFather on Telegram.

If you would like to view the logs as they come in, instead of saving them to a dedicated log-file, add the `--debug` CLI flag: `./launchbot --debug`.

## Data
SQLite: `data/launchbot.db`: houses all data the bot needs to operate, including launch information, statistics, chat preferences, etc.

JSON: `data/config.json`: used to configure the bot by setting the Telegram bot API key, alongside with some other configuration information.

You can specify your personal account's Telegram user ID in `config.json` in the form `owner: 12345`. This disables the logging of commands sent by you.

## Privacy

In order to operate, LaunchBot must save a chat ID. This may or may not be your user ID, depending on whether the chat is a one-on-one or a group chat. The chat ID is used to deliver notifications, manage spam, and keep statistics. Users can optionally store their time zone as a time zone database entry (e.g. Europe/Berlin), which can be removed at any time.

When LaunchBot is added to a new group, it looks up the number of users the group has. Apart from the chat ID, this is the only extra information saved, and is only used to get an idea of the reach of the bot.

The above only applies on a per-bot-instance basis. The creator of the bot chooses whether to configure the bot to be able to read all text messages, not just ones directed at the bot. Telegram bots are, by nature, extremely privacy invasive: don't add unknown bots to group chats, unless it's hosted by you or someone you trust.

	## 1.4 / basic improvements (February 2020 ->)

	- âœ… disable logging of text messages; how to do feedback? (log feedback messages in a global array?)

	- âœ… add location (i.e. state/country) below pad information (Florida, USA etc.)

	
	## 1.5 / user-facing features
	
	- âœ… delete older notification messages when a new one is sent
	
	- [ ] add a "more info"/"less info" button to /next and notification messages

	- âœ… upgrade to the LL2 API (LL1 closes at the end of October)
	
	- âœ… update from telepot Telegram API wrapper to python-telegram-bot
	
	- âœ… perform API requests intelligently, as the monthly request quota is enough for only one request every 8 minutes
	
		- âœ… don't update API on startup, unless it has been sufficiently long since last check: store requests in memory + storage
		
		- âœ… use schedule to schedule requests: just before a launch is due, plus for when notifications are supposed to be sent
		
		- âœ… a raw update schedule of once every 15 - 60 minutes
		
	- âœ… check for launch notifications intelligently
		
		- âœ… on API update, check for updated launch times (notification send times) -> clear schedule queue -> schedule next checks for when a notification is supposed to be sent
		
	- âœ… store LL2 and SpX API data in the same database
	
	- âœ… combine all separate database files into one file with multiple tables
	
	- âœ… attempt to split the monolithic file into multiple separate files, starting with the API request functions
	
	- âœ… index launches by the new unique launch ID instead of launch name

	- âœ… fully integrate new API and notifications systems with LaunchBot 1.5

	- âœ… complete pre_handler(), so we can update time zone information and get feedback

	- âœ… re-add statistics to all needed places

	- âœ… open-source LaunchBot âœ¨
