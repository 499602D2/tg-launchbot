## LaunchBot rework in Go

### Goals of the rework
ðŸŒŸ **Massively improve code quality** and project layout

ðŸŒŸ **Improve robustness** and error recoverability of the backend

ðŸŒŸ **Intelligently dequeue messages** to stay within API limits

ðŸŒŸ **Remove excessive complexity** in storage and caching

ðŸŒŸ **Enable extending the bot** to other platforms through modularity

ðŸŒŸ **Reuse proven Python logic** where possible with direct translation

ðŸŒŸ **Improve performance** by simply switching to Go
