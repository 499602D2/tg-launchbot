## LaunchBot rework in Go

### Goals of the rework
ðŸŒŸ Massively improve code quality and project layout

ðŸŒŸ Improve robustness and error recoverability of the backend

ðŸŒŸ Intelligently dequeue messages to stay within API limits

ðŸŒŸ Remove excessive complexity in storage and caching

ðŸŒŸ Enable extending the bot to other platforms through modularity

ðŸŒŸ Reuse proven Python code where possible with direct translation

ðŸŒŸ Benefit from the performance-upside associated with Go

### To-do
- Error monitoring?

- LaunchLibrary2 API

- Telegram bot API
	- Add error handlers
		- Migrations!!!
	- Implement callbacks
	- Handle callbacks with sender (limits?)
	- Use a dual-limiter
		- Issues with sends?
		- Only add to queue _after_ user has suffered their rate-limit -> easy
	- Use preHandler as middleware

- Add database functions
	- Launch inserts
	- Stats updates
	- User functions
		- Hardest
			- /Notify
			- Chat migrations
		- Rethink

- Add commands
	- /notify
		- Replace /notify with /settings?
		- Database required
			- Use provider IDs (requires reverse mapping, trivial to do manually)
		- More:
			- dynamically generate lists for missing providers
			- Re-think how database inserts are done: try to simplify
	- /next
		- Easy with launch cache
	- /schedule
	- /stats
	- /feedback + response script
	- Admin functions (/debug)

- Database conversion script (Python fine)

### Must-haves before 3.0.0
- "Compress" messages to improve send-rates
	- Add "More info" button
- Remove manual time zone feature to reduce complexity
- Purge log-files when they become too large
	- Alternatively, be smarter about telebot's logging

### Nice-to-haves before 3.0.0
- Notify admin on any processing failure

### Future: 3.1 and onwards
- Handle window starts/ends
	- Instead of continuous postponements, notify of window start -> 5 min notification
- Support for general event types (event/upcoming endpoint)
	- Wrap launches in an Event{} type
	- https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/
- Weekly summary messages
- Web-app based set-up screen, notification info..?
	- https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps
	- Privacy implications
- Discord support
