## LaunchBot rework in Go

### Goals of the rework
ðŸŒŸ **Massively improve code quality** and project layout

ðŸŒŸ **Improve robustness** and error recoverability of the backend

ðŸŒŸ **Intelligently dequeue messages** to stay within API limits

ðŸŒŸ **Remove excessive complexity** in storage and caching

ðŸŒŸ **Enable extending the bot** to other platforms through modularity

ðŸŒŸ **Reuse proven Python logic** where possible with direct translation

ðŸŒŸ **Improve performance** by simply switching to Go

### To-do before 3.0.0
- [ ] LaunchLibrary2 API
	- [x] `/launch/upcoming`
	- [ ] `/lsp`

- [ ] Telegram bot API
	- [ ] Add error handlers
		- [x] Catch-all type handlers 
		- [ ] Migrations
	- [ ] Implement callbacks
		- [ ] Notifications
	- [ ] Handle callbacks with sender (limits?)
	- [ ] Use a dual-limiter
		- Issues with sends?
		- Only add to queue _after_ user has suffered their rate-limit -> easy
	- [ ] Use preHandler as middleware

- [ ] Add database functions
	- [x] Create database, auto-migrations
	- [x] Launch inserts
	- [ ] Stats updates
	- [ ] User functions
		- [ ] Statistics
		- [ ] Time zone  
		- [ ] Notification updates
		- [ ] Chat migrations

- [ ] Caching
	- [x] Launches
	- [ ] Active users
		- [ ] Regularly clean cache (once a day, e.g.)
			- gochron

- [ ] Add commands
	- [ ] /notify
		- Replace /notify with /settings?
		- Database required
			- Use provider IDs (requires reverse mapping, trivial to do manually)
		- More:
			- dynamically generate lists for missing providers
			- Re-think how database inserts are done: try to simplify
	- [ ] /next
		- Easy with launch cache
	- [x] /schedule
		- TODO fix calculated days-until-launch
	- [ ] /stats
	- [ ] /feedback + response script
	- [ ] Admin functions (/debug)

- [ ] Database migration from v2 to v3

### Must-haves before 3.0.0
- [x] "Compress" messages to improve send-rates
	- [x] Add "More info" button
		- [ ] Implement
- [ ] Remove manual time zone feature to reduce complexity
- [ ] Purge log-files when they become too large
	- Also, be smarter about telebot's logging

### Nice-to-haves before 3.0.0
- [ ] Notify admin on any processing failure
	- [x] Telegram

### Future: 3.1 and onwards
- [ ] Handle window starts/ends
	- Instead of continuous postponements, notify of window start -> 5 min notification
- [ ] Support for general event types (event/upcoming endpoint)
	- Wrap launches in an Event{} type
	- https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/
